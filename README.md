WebGPU stuff

Just execute "npm start" in the WebGPUForBeginners directory

Overview of project structure:

    Project is developed using the MVC pattern

    app.ts is the entry point


Note: All the models and images referenced are contained in a separate dist directory outside of src... I didn't want to pay for GitLFS storage on this so if you really want the models you can contact me on discord @ heahaehae
